The Report tool is designed to streamline data retrieval and visualization by combining query refinement, automated response suggestions, and dynamic graph generation. When a user submits a query, the system stores it in chat memory to maintain conversation context. The query is then processed by a fine-tuning agent, which refines it for better accuracy.

To enhance usability, the system also provides pre-stored SQL query suggestions, allowing users to select a relevant response instead of manually crafting a query. Once finalized, the query retrieves data from the knowledge source, which is then processed by the graph generator agent to create visual representations.

The tool offers flexibility in generating both single and multiple graphs, providing in-depth insights tailored to user needs. It also supports visualization for structured and unstructured data, making it a versatile solution for a wide range of analytical use cases.
