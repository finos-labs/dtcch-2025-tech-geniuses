This system is designed to efficiently process and organize both structured and unstructured data, enabling seamless information retrieval. It begins by classifying incoming files—such as PDFs, audio recordings, videos, images, and databases—using a Large Language Model (LLM). Structured data, like databases and spreadsheets, undergo schema extraction and summarization for better understanding and storage. Unstructured data is processed through various techniques, including OCR for text extraction, speech-to-text conversion for audio, and image recognition for visual content. The extracted information is then cleaned, summarized, and enriched with metadata before being stored in a cloud repository. To enhance searchability, the system applies chunking and vectorization, utilizing tools like AWS Kendra, OpenSearch, or custom models to create an efficient knowledge base. This architecture ensures that disparate data sources are transformed into structured, searchable, and actionable insights, facilitating advanced data management and retrieval
